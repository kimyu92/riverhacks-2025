# ToSafeToBee :two: :green_heart: :two: :bee: - ATX

## üöÄ Description
ToSafeToBee is a unified platform designed to connect people in need ‚Äî especially the homeless ‚Äî with NGOs, shelters, food banks, healthcare services, and local support organizations around them.


### Key Features

- **Zipcode-based Discovery**: Enter your area and see resources mapped close to you.
- **Scalable Platform**: Easily extendable to new cities and states.
- **NGO Partnership Portal (Coming Soon)**: NGOs can register and manage their resources directly.
- **Future AI Integration**: Use WebAI to match people with personalized help (planned).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js and ShadCN
- **Backend**: Python Flask RESTful API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Git

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kimyu92/riverhacks-2025.git
cd riverhacks-2025
```

2. Start the application with Docker Compose:
```bash
# Start all services in detached mode
make start

# Alternative: Start with logs visible
make start-logs
```

3. Set up the database:
```bash
# Reset and seed the database (recommended for first-time setup)
make db-reset

# Or just seed the database if it's already set up
make db-seed
```

This will populate the database with organizations, users, shelters, hospitals, food resources, and safety reports for testing.

4. Access the application:
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

### Common Command Scenarios

```bash
# View logs from all running services
make logs

# View logs for a specific service
make logs-service service=backend

# Access the PostgreSQL database CLI
make db

# Reset database completely (useful when schema changes)
make db-reset

# Stop all services without removing containers
make stop

# Stop and remove all containers
make down

# Remove Docker images to force rebuild (useful when dependencies change)
make remove-images

# Access backend container shell (for debugging)
make backend-shell

# Access frontend container shell
make frontend-shell

# Install frontend dependencies
make frontend-install

# Run frontend development server separately
make frontend-dev
```

### Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Backend setup:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Frontend setup:
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## üì° API Endpoints

### Authentication Example

Most endpoints require authentication. First, obtain a JWT token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "<access_token>",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "organization_id": null,
    "role": "admin",
    "username": "admin"
  }
}
```

Then use the token in subsequent requests:

```bash
# public
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/shelters

# authed protected
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/shelters \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Emergency Relief Center",
    "location": "123 Oak Street, Austin, TX 78701",
    "wheelchair_accessible": true,
    "visual_accommodations": false,
    "audio_accommodations": true
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Image Reset Scenarios

If you encounter any of these issues, you may need to reset your Docker images using `make remove-images`:

- Backend or frontend dependencies have changed (package.json or requirements.txt updated)
- Docker containers are not reflecting your latest code changes
- You're experiencing unusual errors after pulling new changes
- Docker container builds are failing with cached layer issues

Reset process:

```bash
# Stop all running containers
make down

# Remove Docker images to force a complete rebuild
make remove-images

# Start services again (this will rebuild the images)
make start
```

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Errors
```
# Reset the database completely
make db-reset
```

#### Frontend Not Loading Correctly
```
# Access frontend container
make frontend-shell

# Install or update dependencies
pnpm install

# Exit shell and restart
exit
make frontend-start
```

#### Backend API Not Working
```
# View backend logs
make logs-service service=backend

# Access backend shell for debugging
make backend-shell
```

#### Docker Container Won't Start
```
# Check running containers
make ps

# Remove containers and volumes
docker compose down -v

# Start clean
make start
```
