# ToSafeToBee :two: :green_heart: :two: :bee: - ATX

## üöÄ Description

ToSafeToBee is an innovative mobile-first web application designed to enhance public safety, accessibility, and community engagement in Austin, especially during emergencies. The platform provides real-time information about critical resources, accessible emergency locations, and community-reported safety issues.

Our mission is to ensure that all Austin residents, including those with disabilities, can quickly access vital information during emergencies and contribute to community safety through a collaborative platform.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Resource Locator**: Interactive map displaying emergency locations (shelters, hospitals, cooling stations)
- **Accessibility Filtering**: Find resources filtered by wheelchair accessibility and visual/audio accommodations
- **Smart Local Chatbot**: AI-powered assistance that works offline for emergency preparedness information
- **Community Engagement**: Report safety issues, accessibility barriers, and share available resources
- **Configurable Alerts**: Customizable notifications for local emergencies based on proximity

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js and ShadCN
- **Backend**: Python Flask RESTful API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI Integration**: Local LLM (Ollama) with webAI
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Git

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kimyu92/riverhacks-2025.gi
cd riverhacks-2025
```

2. Start the application with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- Backend Flask API on port 5000
- Frontend development server (when uncommented in compose.yml)

3. Seed the database with sample data:
```bash
# Option 1: Using Docker (recommended)
docker compose exec backend python -m db.seed

# Option 2: Running directly (if you have local environment set up)
cd backend
python -m db.seed
```

This will populate the database with organizations, users, shelters, hospitals, food resources, and safety reports for testing.

4. Access the application:
- API: http://localhost:5000
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (when frontend service is enabled)

### Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Backend setup:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Frontend setup (when implemented):
```bash
cd app
pnpm install
```
